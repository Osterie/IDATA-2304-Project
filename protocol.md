# Communication protocol

This document describes the protocol used for communication between the different nodes of the
distributed application.

## Terminology

* Sensor - a device which senses the environment and describes it with a value (an integer value in
  the context of this project). Examples: temperature sensor, humidity sensor.
* Actuator - a device which can influence the environment. Examples: a fan, a window opener/closer,
  door opener/closer, heater.
* Sensor and actuator node - a computer which has direct access to a set of sensors, a set of
  actuators and is connected to the Internet.
* Control-panel node - a device connected to the Internet which visualizes status of sensor and
  actuator nodes and sends control commands to them.
* Graphical User Interface (GUI) - A graphical interface where users of the system can interact with
  it.

## The underlying transport protocol

TODO - what transport-layer protocol do you use? TCP? UDP? What port number(s)? Why did you choose this transport layer protocol?
- TCP 
- Port number: 50500
- We chose TCP because it is a connection-oriented protocol, which means that it guarantees the delivery of packets to the destination node. This is important for our system because we want to make sure that all messages are delivered to the destination node.



## The architecture

TODO - show the general architecture of your network. Which part is a server? Who are clients? 
Do you have one or several servers? Perhaps include a picture here. 


## The flow of information and events

TODO - describe what each network node does and when. Some periodic events? Some reaction on 
incoming packets? Perhaps split into several subsections, where each subsection describes one 
node type (For example: one subsection for sensor/actuator nodes, one for control panel nodes).

## Connection and state

TODO - is your communication protocol connection-oriented or connection-less? Is it stateful or 
stateless? 

## Types, constants

TODO - Do you have some specific value types you use in several messages? They you can describe 
them here.

## Message format

TODO - describe the general format of all messages. Then describe specific format for each 
message type in your protocol.

TODO
What we need
Header.
- Who is the receiver (GREENHOUSE or CONTROL_PANEL)
- ID of the receiver
- Data type

BODY
- Command


Result:
- DST;DST_ID;DATA_TYPE COMMAND
- GREENHOUSE;AllId;STRING GET_NODE_ID

### Error messages

TODO - describe the possible error messages that nodes can send in your system.

## An example scenario

TODO - describe a typical scenario. How would it look like from communication perspective? When 
are connections established? Which packets are sent? How do nodes react on the packets? An 
example scenario could be as follows:
1. A sensor node with ID=1 is started. It has a temperature sensor, two humidity sensors. It can
   also open a window.
2. A sensor node with ID=2 is started. It has a single temperature sensor and can control two fans
   and a heater.
3. A control panel node is started.
4. Another control panel node is started.
5. A sensor node with ID=3 is started. It has a two temperature sensors and no actuators.
6. After 5 seconds all three sensor/actuator nodes broadcast their sensor data.
7. The user of the first-control panel presses on the button "ON" for the first fan of
   sensor/actuator node with ID=2.
8. The user of the second control-panel node presses on the button "turn off all actuators".

## Reliability and security

### Security:
  - For security of the data the AES encryption method is used.

  - Justification for AES: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a widely used, efficient, and secure
  symmetric encryption algorithm. It provides confidentiality by ensuring that the data sent
  over the network cannot be read by anyone who doesnâ€™t have the encryption key. AES is
  chosen because it balances performance and security, making it suitable for both small and
  large-scale applications. It is considered highly secure when using proper key management.

  - Justification for symmetric encryption: Using symmetric encryption simplifies the process because the same key is
  used for both encryption and decryption. This avoids the complexity of key pair
  management (as seen in asymmetric encryption like RSA), which makes it suitable for
  applications where the sender and receiver can securely share a common secret key.

### Reliability:
  - For reliability a hashing algorithm is being used.

  - Justification for hashing algorithm: Hashing algorithms like SHA-256 are used to ensure data integrity. The hash
  function generates a fixed-size output (hash) that uniquely represents the message. When
  transmitting messages over unreliable networks, hashes can verify the integrity of the
  message and ensure it has not been tampered with or altered. This also provides
  lightweight verification without adding computational overhead.

    - Message Integrity Check: By hashing the message on both the sender and receiver
  sides, we ensure that any corruption during transmission can be detected. If the
  received hash doesn't match the hash computed on the receiver's side, the message is
  considered tampered or corrupted, and the sender is notified to resend.
