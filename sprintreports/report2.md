## **Risks & Dependencies**
- **Risk 1:** [Description and impact on project]
- **Dependency 1:** [External dependency affecting sprint completion]

---

## **Retrospective Summary**
- **What Went Well:**
  - Good collaboration between team members.
  - Successful implementation of new features and corresponding tests.
  - Effective communication during task distribution with new TODO list.

- **What Could Be Improved:**
  - Better documentation for ongoing development tasks to reduce knowledge gaps.
  - Earlier identification of blockers to minimize delays.
---

## **Next Steps**
- Focus on completing messaging functionality.
- Improve communication on cross-functional dependencies.
