# WORK PROCESS DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
provide some form of documentation of the following:
- [ ] KNUT 1. How the work was planned in terms of iterations (sprints)
- [x] ADRIAN 2. How the tasks were distributed - who was responsible for what. Note - it is NOT OK to have someone in the group responsible only for creating videos. This course is primarily about network protocols and network programming. Every group member must demonstrate expertise within these fields. Perhaps one student works more on the protocol, another on the server programming, and the third on client programming, that is fine. But it is not fine if one student does all the programming, one just writes documentation (sprint reports) and the third creates a video. How are the second and third students showing their computer network expertise?



## How the tasks were distributed
For programming, after having analyzed what the task required us to do, we wrote down these tasks as TODOs under our version control. These tasks were further subdivided into smaller tasks and distributed between the different members of the group. Whilst working on the project, we naturally wrote down more TODOs. To distribute the TODOs we talked to eachother about which tasks we wanted to complete, and if we completed our TODOs we would assign ourselves to new ones.  

For work process documentation, we were appointed different parts of the documentation to complete, with the work load slightly varying based on workload in other parts of the project. Finally for the video we were all assigned different parts to work on and create, but we also helped eachother with writing scripts. Everyone was assigned a part of the video, but again how much was spoken was also based on how much the person had already done. Still, everyone helped eachother with the video, and everyone had a part in creating the video.

## Who was responsible for what. 

When programming we did not assign people areas to work on. TODOs were not distributed necessarily based on what other TODOs a member worked on, which was to try to ensure that everyone leared about all parts of the project. Also for writing protocol, everyone were given the responsibility of writing some part of the protocol. 

For completing the work process documentation, everyone was assigned different tasks, which ensured that everyone contributed to all aspects of the project. For the final video everyone had some part to create for the video. 



- [ ] KNUT 3. How was the work broken down into issues? Remember the principles you learned about issue
definition in the System development course. Issues should be small, have descriptive names,
clear "definition of done", etc. For example, an issue like "improve GUI" is a bad issue. What
does it mean? When is it complete?
- [ ] DANIEL 4. How the work was progressing - what did you accomplish in each sprint? Which issues were
planned, and which ones were completed?
- [x] SEBASTIAN 5. A short retrospective after each sprint - what went well, and how can you improve?

It is suggested that you keep the sprint documentation in Git as well, but you are allowed to use
Wiki pages, Jira or other tools if you want.
